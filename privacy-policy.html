            <p>At Edwin's Picks, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your data when you visit our website or use our services, including our integration with Pinterest's API.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you interact with our site or connect via Pinterest, we may collect your name, email address, or Pinterest profile information (e.g., username, profile ID) with your explicit consent through Pinterest's OAuth authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We collect usage data such as IP addresses, browser type, device information, and website interactions (e.g., pages visited, links clicked) via cookies or analytics tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Affiliate Data:</strong> When you click affiliate links (e.g., Amazon Affiliate Program), we may collect anonymized data about your clicks or purchases to track commissions, as permitted by our affiliate partners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="policy-title">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

            <h3 class="policy-title">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services like Pinterest (for API integration) or analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics) that help us operate our site.</li>
